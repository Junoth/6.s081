1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a2

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.the call to function f has been optimized in main by complier
the call to function g has been inlined in line 14

3. At what address is the function printf located?
0x630

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x30

5. What is the output? 
He110 World

6. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
0x726c6400

7. Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
No

8. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
It depends on the value in a2 register when calling the function. We use a2 register as the second parameter but we don't provide a value so it will some arbitrary number.
